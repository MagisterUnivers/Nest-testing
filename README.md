This project is a platform that enables user registration via Telegram and allows for viewing registered users. The backend is built using **NestJS** with a PostgreSQL database, and the frontend is developed using **Next.js**. The platform lets users register, view profiles (but not edit them), making it a secure and streamlined experience for managing Telegram-based registrations.
